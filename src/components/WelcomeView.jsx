					<p>You are about to play a game of "The Mole".</p>
					<p>
						In this game, you will work together as a team to complete a series of challenges. For every
						challenge you win, you will add points to a group pot that in the end will be awarded to only
						one of you. At the beginning of the game, one of you will randomly be selected to be "The Mole"
						and it will be that player's objective to stop you from winning points by sabotaging your
						efforts all while keeping their identity a secret.
					</p>
					<p>
						The game is played in rounds called "episodes" where in each "episode" you will work together to
						complete a number of challenges. You will have the ability to win points in some challenges
						while in others, you will have the chance to win something else that may be of personal benefit.
						At the same time, the mole will be trying to sabotage each challenge so, as a player, you will
						want to be on the lookout for suspicious behaviour.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the end of each episode you will each take a ten question multiple choice quiz about the
						identity of the mole. The quiz will have questions like "How tall is the mole?" and "What role
						did the mole have during a certain challenge?". The player who gets the fewest questions correct
						will be eliminated from the game so not only is it important to work well together to win points
						but it is also important to keep track of your fellow players as anyone of them could be the
						mole.
					</p>
					<p>
						The reason for winning points is because, in the final episode, the last remaining player will
						play a final challenge against the mole. The more points that the players won throughout the
						game, the better of a chance the last remaining player will have at winning that challenge.
					</p>
					<p>One piece of advice before beginning the game: "Trust Nobody".</p>
